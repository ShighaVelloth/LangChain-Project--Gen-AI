#  Eyes of AI: Empowering the Visually Impaired with Smarter Image Analysis

This project is an **AI-powered assistant** designed to help visually impaired individuals understand their surroundings through images. The app offers the following functionalities:  

- **🎯 Object and Scene Recognition**  
- **🔍 Text Detection (OCR) and Conversion**  
- **🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS) for Audio Descriptions**  
- **⚠️ Hazard Detection and Safety Alerts**  

---

## **Features**  

- **Image-to-Text and Audio Conversion**  
  Extracts text from uploaded images and converts it into **audio** for seamless accessibility.  

- **Contextual Scene Understanding**  
  Provides descriptive summaries of **objects**, **text**, and **symbols** within the image for better comprehension.  

- **Hazard Detection**  
  Identifies potential **risks** or **obstacles** in the image and provides **safety alerts** to assist with navigation.  

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  A simple and intuitive UI optimized for visually impaired users with **single-click operations** and organized tabs for easy navigation.
